# Simple To-Do Manager

Description: A command-line tool to manage tasks with permanent data storage.

Features: Adding, viewing, deleting tasks, and automatic saving to JSON.

What I Learned: In this project, I learned file handling, JSON serialization and error handling.

PS: This is my 1st day of coding in Python. I am sure this project isn't the best, and I will improve it as soon as possible.
